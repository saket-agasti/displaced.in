    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Displaced Indica is a knowledge-building and community-driven initiative focused on the ecological and social dimensions of village relocation from India's protected areas. The project highlights the historical context, policy landscape, spatial mapping, and lived experiences of displaced communities and the wildlife they share space with.

      <b>What happens when wildlife conservation meets the boundaries of human settlement?</b>
      Displaced Indica is an AI-assisted initiative dedicated to unpacking one of the most complex and under-discussed dimensions of modern conservation in India ‚Äî the relocation of communities for the sake of wildlife protection.
    <br>
    <p>
      Across the subcontinent, forests are being restored, tiger populations are rising, and protected areas are expanding. But in this effort to reclaim wilderness, thousands of families ‚Äî many of them indigenous forest dwellers ‚Äî have been asked to leave behind their homes, lands, and legacies. These are not just stories of loss, but also of transition, adaptation, and resilience.    </p>
